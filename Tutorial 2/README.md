# Working with the basics - Python for the instructions

In this tutorial, we are using Python to link everything together. Ollama to work for LLM, Streamlit for the front-end interface and Pocketflow for the AI agent structure - all linked together with Python as the programming language and interface. So you definitely want to know some basics about Python before moving on. These links are maintained with the following Python basics:

* Dictionary and other variable declation for variable passing in Streamlit and Pocketflow
* String variable declaration and modification for communication with Ollama
* Function delcaration for the nodes and flows in Pocketflow
* Loops for more effective communication with Ollama

Not knowing what they are? Run your """Anaconda Prompt" to exeucte

```cmd
jupyter notebook
```

and open the *00.2 Preliminaries - Python syntax recap.ipynb* notebook in this directory to review these basics!
